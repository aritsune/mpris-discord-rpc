## Changes:

- Set Discord RPC activity type to "Listening".
- Listening progress bar similar to Spofity.
- Album name is now displayed.
- Fixed detection of track duration, current position and start/end time calculation.
- From now on, the program checks if the directory to which it tries to save the cache file exists. The cache should now work properly.
