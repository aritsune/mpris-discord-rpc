## Changes:

- Added option to customize "Listening to" text on the Discord user list. It now looks the same as the Spotify RPC, but you can also choose to show either the artist name or the song title.
- The song title is now a link that searches for the song on YouTube.
- Minor bug fixes.
- Updated dependencies to latest versions.
